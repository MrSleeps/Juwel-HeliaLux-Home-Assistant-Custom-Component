## Disable any other integrations (such as HomeKit) that are also interacting with your Juwel controller

## Make sure you have read the Readme before filing a bug issue, if the issue requires logs and you don't provide debug logs I probably won't look into it (sorry! it's a simple request)

## Be aware that I don't upgrade Home Assistant the day a new version comes out, I usually wait until at least the .2 version comes out, if you upgrade on the day it's released please don't expect a quick fix
